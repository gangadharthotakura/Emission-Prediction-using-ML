📘 Emission Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts the CO₂ emission of vehicles based on various engine and vehicle features using Machine Learning models. It's a regression-based project built using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

🔍 Problem Statement
Given a dataset of car specifications (like engine size, fuel consumption, cylinders, etc.), the goal is to predict the CO₂ emissions of vehicles accurately.

📁 Dataset
